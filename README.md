# multilingual_emotion_detection
Features
Preprocessing of audio datasets in multiple languages

Extraction of relevant features (e.g., MFCCs)

Training and evaluation of emotion classification models

Visualization of performance metrics

Support for different datasets (e.g., RAVDESS, EMO-DB)

Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Librosa (for audio processing)

Scikit-learn (for ML models and evaluation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

How to Run
Clone the repository or download the .ipynb file.

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install librosa scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy pandas
Run the notebook step-by-step:

Load and preprocess audio data

Extract features

Train the emotion classification model

Evaluate and visualize the results

Datasets
RAVDESS

EMO-DB (Berlin Database of Emotional Speech)

Results
The notebook provides accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports to evaluate the performance of the emotion detection system across different languages and datasets.
